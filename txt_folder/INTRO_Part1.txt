You are an adventurer, lacking esteem but not experience. You have chosen a path of risk and violence, hoping that one day, maybe - just maybe - you will take on a gig big enough that your name will be known amongst everyone.
It is late at night and you are at a tavern treating yourself for your most recently completed contract. After all, a nice mug of ale is more than capable of washing down the dust you inhaled while fighting those pesky kobolds.
As the bottom of your mug starts pointing at the ceiling, you spot a relatively young man sporting a fancy blue tunic short-sleeved with a white undershirt, pitch black trousers held on by a belt with a silver buckle and boots with copper engravings. He appears to be walking from table to table asking people questions. 
Suspecting a reward, and with nothing better to do at the moment, you approach the man, and after a brief introduction, you ask if you may be of help. Ignoring most of his blabbering, you learn what you need: he lent money to an adventuring party, the "Firestormers" or whatnot, and now that they need to pay, they are nowhere to be seen. Only clue about the party's whereabouts is their mentioning of the Dungeon of a Dimius Averkorf.
"Standard debt collection you think", a bit dissappointed. You manage to avoid committing yourself to the job, but reassure him to return the debt if you find them. This could set you up with a useful acquintance or land you a hefty sum of gold.
Out of professional curiosity, you decide to head to the library to learn more about the Dungeon and its whereabouts.
