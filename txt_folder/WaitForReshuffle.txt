You decide that the dungeon is not safe to traverse in its current state. You spot the rope with which you descended into the dungeon to begin with. 
You grab it and begin to ascend towards the clear sky. As you exit, you anticipate the sweet sound of the stone rooms shifting once more.
You see the magic barrier form, after what to you feels like hours. Once the barrier vanishes, you jump back into the entrance, ready to explore the dungeon once more.
