It takes you a week to reach Kirstow Cliff. The journey is smooth and quiet, save for that one pair of bandits that attacked you on the evening of the third day, but you were able to scare them away. On the seventh day, as you circle the place that is meant to be cliff you are looking for, you see an empty camp. It looks to have been abandoned a couple of weeks ago. The camp is located near a rock formation that, while well hidden, gives away the location of the entrance. There, you see it with your own eyes: a stone engraving covered in moss and foliage that reads: Averkorf Dungeon. And some other warnings... blah, blah, treasure awaits. 
The stairs that would have comprised the entrance are collapsed, which makes sense given that the wizard was trying to prevent people from entering in the first place. You find a strong nearby tree branch to tie a rope to to allow your safe descent. After waiting for a few hours, you see a magic barrier block the entrance, while you notice the sound of stone components grinding against one another; "That must be the shifting process." you think as the magic barrier deactivates.
Without a second wasted you descend into the dungeon using the rope, landing on the first of its many rooms. 
The goal is simple: Find the 1000th room, obtain the treasure, get out.
