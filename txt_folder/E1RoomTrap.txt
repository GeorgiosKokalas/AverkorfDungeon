ENDING 2: Trapped
-----------------
As you stand in the room looking for your next passageway, you see no door in sight. As you frantically look for an exit the realization hits you:
You are trapped within this room. You feel the walls of the room taunting you, closing in.
As the horror settles in, it becomes abundantly clear that you are to remain here for the rest of your life. You will die a slow and torturous death, by starving to death.
After what feels like hours, hollowed of any emotion, you ready your dagger and slit your own throat in an attempt to leave this world in your own terms.
As you draw your last breath, your soul becomes tethered in the dungeon, cursed to forever wander it and watch as other fools meet their end just like you did.
