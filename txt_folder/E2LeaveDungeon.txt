Ending 1: Leaving the Dungeon
-----------------------------
You stand at the entrance of the dungeon, evaluating your options. You can pursue the treasure further, or you can call it quits.
Now that you think of it, you cannot recall a single person that went into this dungeon and came out filthy rich. This thought haunts your mind as you sit down on the cold floor, legs crossed.
You place your elbows on your knees and rest your head on the palms of your hands, as you further think about your options: You have NO proof this treasure even exists. All you have are records of people who went in this dungeon before you. People who were either never heard from again, or people that spent months trying to find an optimal layout before they gave up.
Is this all a lie? The treasure, the power, the b!tches? Is this maze just a sadistic joke to lure people into their deaths?
Maybe it is, maybe it is not. And even if the treasure exists, how valuable is it really? Is it even still there?
Well, you decide that this question is not for you to find out. Let someone else have all the glory if they wish so. You understand that if there is anything valuable within sight, that is your own life.
You get up, scanning the rope with which you entered the dungeon. As you climb it up to leave, you take a long last look below at the room and the marble floor tiles. They once looked so inviting, yet now they look like fangs trying to grapple your feet.
You climb out of the entrance, having made a decision people stronger than you were too weak-willed to do. You set afoot and do not look back.
Until temptation starts eating away at your soul once more, that is.
