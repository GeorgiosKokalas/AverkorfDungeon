The wizard, maddened by his desperation used his conductor, an amulet shaped like an hourglass, to shift the mines into a proper dungeon. Records include wild tales of a stream of gold flowing from the royal palace into the dungeon. Not just that, but it is also mentioned that the dungeon itself shifts in architecture every day, even to this day. Naturally, what happened to the wizard himself remains a mystery, as peasants who entered the dungeon were never seen again. It is also rumored aparently that the treasure lies at the 1000th room of the dungeon.
But that was irrelevant; you were hooked. An amulet powerful enough to conduct telekinesis over miles? To create a perpetually changing building? This amulet is extremely powerful, and you know that it must rest within your hands. You can't even sell it; this item would be priceless! You fantasize about the influence, the power it would bring you. There is no other question: You. Must. Have. It. The amulet, and every single golden coin included in that place.
There are reports of many adventuring parties attempting to raid the dungeon and never being heard from again, but honestly: who cares? Those were probably some low level scum. They couldn't distinguish a kobold from a goblin. But you are different; you are the real deal. A real adventurer. Someone who is wise and cautious. Were others failed, you will surely succeed.
By the time you exit the library, it is dusk. You get some sleep and the next day you prepare for the long road ahead.
