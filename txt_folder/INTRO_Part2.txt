The next day at the library, your studies show a lot about this Averkorf character:
Apparently, Dimius Lazarous Ivan Averkorf was a renowed wizard for the Kingdom of Yemshtova, centuries ago. He had the amount of fame that you had been dreaming of obtaining all this time. Not just that, his skills had landed him in a position as one of King Borsech's royal advisors. Naturally, his position landed him with literal mountains of gold and jewelry. "Who cares a small adventuring party anyways?" you asked yourself as you found an even bigger target. Surely the loan the adventurers wer given wasn't near enough the wealth hidden within the wizard's coffers.
Reading more about him, you spot something interesting: due to his influence, Averkorf eventually became politically corrupt, leading him to advise King Borsech into passing bills one more ludicrous than the last. One such attempt involve convincing the king to go into war with the city states of Jonfresie, a conflict so bloody that it nearly brought the kingdom to ruin. The people revolted in such a violent manner that Averkorf was forced to flee to the ruins of an abandoned mine at Kirstow Cliff, now known as the Averkorf Dungeon.
"This is odd. A mine?" you think out loud.
